# UK Covid relief grants: data analysis

This report, by [360Giving](https://www.threesixtygiving.org/), uses data published by funders about the grants they made between March 2020 and October 2021 during the Coronavirus pandemic to understand how they and wider civil society responded during that time.

Explore the findings using the menu on this page or **[download the report](data/covid_grants_research.pdf)** [PDF 3MB].

You can view an **[overview of the findings](overview.md)**, information on **[why we did the research](about.md)** and a description of the **[method used](method.md)**. The report looks at three main areas:

 - **[Characteristics of the grants themselves](about-grants/over-time.md)**: how they changed over time, how much they were for and how long they were.
 - **[The grant recipients](grant-recipients/recipient-types.md)**: which types of organisations were funded, and which parts of civil society were funded.
 - **[Patterns of funding](funding-patterns/changing-spend.md)**: whether funders changed how they fund, and whether organisations had previously received funding.
