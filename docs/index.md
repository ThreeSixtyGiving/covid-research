# Introduction

## Coronavirus relief grants

The 2020 Coronavirus pandemic provided a unique challenge to UK charities and the people and communities they benefit. Charities needed to meet the massive demand and need for their services, particularly from their most vulnerable users, whilst simultaneously having to stop many of their in-person services and fundraising activities to keep their staff, volunteers and service users safe.

Grant-making funders recognised the scale and urgency of this emergency, and responded by designing and deploying new grant programmes, and adapting existing programmes. These programmes aimed both to:

Help organisations meet the increased and unique demands created by the pandemic
Help organisations ensure their own survival given anticipated drops in other funding sources

360Giving helped this response by supporting grantmakers to publish data about the grants they had made. We also created the Covid-19 Grants Tracker which aggregated the published grants data in a single tool, and enabled collaboration and intelligence sharing between grantmakers.

## About 360Giving

Our mission is to help UK funders publish open, standardised grants data, and empower people to use it to improve charitable giving.

When funders publish information on who, where and what they fund in the 360Giving Data Standard it means they are sharing it in a way that others can access and use for free. Because the data is standardised, it can be looked at and analysed all together, helping us to see and understand grantmaking across the UK. Having this information means funding can be more informed and effective.

We support people to publish their data in the 360Giving Data Standard. We also help people to access and use the data, and have created tools to make it easy to explore, download and visualise the data.

You can find out more about 360Giving on our website, or search and explore published grants data using GrantNav and 360Insights.
