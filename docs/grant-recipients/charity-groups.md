# Charity groups receiving grants

**Charities working in domestic or sexual abuse were more likely to receive a grant**

The tags shown here allow charities to be grouped in a finer level of detail than the sectors shown on the previous page. The tags are based on the [UK-CAT classification](https://charityclassification.org.uk/). 

Charities are assigned one or more tags based on the keywords that appear in their name and how they describe their activities. In total the system contains more than 250 tags.

The list to the right shows the 20 tags where the highest proportion of charities received a grant. It shows some of the areas that funding was most successful in reaching.

Itâ€™s important to note that in some cases charities can be in more than one tag, and the same charity may appear more than once in this list. Tags are only included if there are more than 200 charities in them.
