# Grants as a proportion of total income

**Most charities received grants equivalent to less than 25% of their latest annual income**

Using figures for 2019-20, it is possible to look at the amount of grants received by registered charities as a proportion of their most recent income figure. This gives a sense of the scale of the grants compared to the scale of organisations themselves. 

The majority of charities - 70% - received the equivalent of up to 25% of their annual income in grants. 15% of charities received grants equivalent to 50% of their prior income or more. 

These figures are based on the latest annual income recorded by the Charity Commission for England and Wales, the Scottish Charity Regulator or the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland.
