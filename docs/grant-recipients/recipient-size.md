# Size of grant recipients

**More grants went to mid-sized charities**

For the 39,000 grants to registered charities, it is possible to look at the size of the charity based on their latest recorded income in £GBP. Due to lags in reporting financial details to the charity regulators, this income generally represents the last year before the pandemic (2019-20 financial year), rather than the 2020-21 financial year.

Most grants to registered charities - 20,000 out of the 39,000 total grants to charities - went to those charities with an income between £100,000 and £1 million. 

Organisations with incomes below £100,000 received 9,200 grants (25% of grants) while those with income over £1 million received 7,000 grants (19% of grants).

57% of the grant amount received by charities went to those with income over £1 million. 

It's important to note that these figures don't include grants to unregistered charities and community groups, which did receive grants from some funds. These unregistered organisations will usually have income of less than £10,000.
