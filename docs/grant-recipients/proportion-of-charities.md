# Proportion of charities receiving a grant

**One in ten UK charities received a grant**

Based on 160,000 active registered charities throughout the UK, one in ten charities received a grant from one of the Covid relief funds analysed here.

The charities that received funding represent around 25% of the total charity income in the UK, and the grants they received were equivalent to 1.2% of the total latest income of all charities (and equivalent to 4.7% of the latest income of charities that received grants).

These figures varied by size of organisation though. Over 25% of charities with more than £100,000 income received a grant, compared to 7% of charities with income between £10,000 and £100,000.

For charities with income under £100,000 that received a grant, the grant was equivalent to 42% of their total latest income, while for larger charities the grant was a much smaller proportion of their income.
