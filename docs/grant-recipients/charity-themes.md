# Charity themes receiving grants

**Health charities were most likely to receive a grant**

The International Classification of Non-Profit and Third Sector Organisations (ICNP/TSO) is a system designed to classify non-profit organisations. Using data from [a recent project](https://charityclassification.org.uk/) which applied the categories to UK charities it is possible to see which parts of the charity sector were more likely to receive funding.

Charities in the health and social services sectors, which often support the most vulnerable people, were most likely to receive a grant. 38% of health charities received a grant in this dataset, plus 31% of social service charities. This was followed by arts, culture and sport (all of which had dedicated funding) as well as community and housing organisations.

The groups least likely to receive a grant were environmental & animal charities, where 5% of charities received a grant, and religious organisations, where 7% received a grant.
