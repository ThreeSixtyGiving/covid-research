# Methodology

## Where is the data from?

This report is based on data published using the [360Giving Data Standard](http://www.threesixtygiving.org/support-2/standard/) by a range of grantmakers. The 360Giving Data Standard defines a standard format for publishing information about a grant, including the amount, the date of the grant, the recipient organisation and the funder. The data is published in an open format, which allows anyone to use the data.

The data covers grants made between the start of the Coronavirus pandemic in March 2020 and October 2021, although not all publishers have data covering the whole period.

As well as grant information published in the 360Giving Data Standard, this report supplements the main open dataset with data from key covid funds that have not yet published in the Standard. These datasets include:

- [Culture Recovery Fund](https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/CRFgrants) (DCMS funds distributed by Arts Council England)
- [Culture Recovery Fund for Heritage](https://www.heritagefund.org.uk/funding/culture-recovery-fund-emergency-resource) (DCMS funds distributed by National Lottery Heritage Fund)
- [London Community Response](https://londoncommunityresponsefund.org.uk/) (data provided by London Funders)

## What data is missing?

The pandemic has provided an impetus for funders to publish data about their grant funding, in order to better coordinate their activities with the wider sector. However, not all funders who made grants during the pandemic have published data openly about their funding.

Where possible, these gaps were filled by accessing other data sources, either published by the funders themselves (but not in 360Giving format) or by talking directly to the funders.

Some large grant schemes have not published data about their funds, and so cannot be included in the analysis here. **This report should therefore be seen as an analysis of a large proportion of the grantmaking that happened during the pandemic, but not the totality.**

In some cases there also may be duplicate records found in the data. This can happen where a funder took part in multiple collaborative efforts - this can lead to the information being published in more than one place. While all efforts were made to remove any duplicate grants, some may remain in the data.
