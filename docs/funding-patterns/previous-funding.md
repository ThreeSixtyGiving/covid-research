# Have recipients previously been funded?

**35% of recipients had previously received funding from the same funder**

In order to look at whether grant recipients had previously received grant funding, either from the same funder or from another funder in the 360Giving dataset, it is necessary to narrow down the field. Grants were included in this analysis if:

- The funder has published at least 4 years of grants data since 2015
- The funder has published some grants data relating to their covid grantmaking
- The recipient was a registered charity

Using these criteria results in grants from 103 funders, down from 170 in the initial dataset. Looking at covid grants from these funders, around 35% of grant recipients had previously received funding from the same funder, while a further 39% had received funding from other funders in the same dataset. This left 26% of grant recipients that had not previously appeared in the dataset (although they may have received funding from other funders not included in the dataset).

The chart shows how this varied between the funds included in the report.
