# Grants from multiple funders

**38% of recipients received a grant from more than one funder**

Around half of all registered charities (48%) received more than one grant in the dataset, including 26% that received  three or more grants.

38% of charity recipients received grants from more than one funder in the dataset. This includes 17% that received grants from three or more funders.

Larger organisations were more likely to receive grants from multiple funders, but mid-sized charities with annual income between £100,000 and £1 million were similarly likely to receive multiple grants.

These reflect the patterns of funding activity, where some funds were distributed in several rounds that the same organisations could apply to. Early rounds of funding often provided shorter-term emergency funding, with further grants made as longer term needs emerged.
