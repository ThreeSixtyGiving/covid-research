# Funding other funders

**Regranting**

As funders worked together to respond to the pandemic, they sometimes used re-granting to achieve their goals. Funds were passed through other organisations to reach particular groups that were expected to be underrepresented or disproportionately impacted by the pandemic and associated public health measures, such as charities working with minoritised communities.

Because data is not available on the organisations that were the final recipients of these grants, and to avoid double counting of grants, these re-grants have not been included in this report. However, the chart shown here demonstrates the range of funding that flowed through intermediary funders.
