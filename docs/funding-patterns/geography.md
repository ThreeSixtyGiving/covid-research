# Distribution by country and region

**Charities working in domestic or sexual abuse were more likely to receive a grant**

Looking at how these grants vary across countries, regions and smaller areas is an important component of analysis. However, due to limitations in the data, we were not able to complete this analysis. We came across several barriers:

- Because not all funders publish data, there are gaps in geographic coverage of the data. For example, not all Community Foundations publish data.
- Geographic data does not always indicate where the grant took place. In the 360Giving Data Standard you can include both the location of the recipient organisation or the beneficiaries of the grant. Both of these fields are optional, so data is incomplete.

360Giving are currently working on a project with grantmakers to improve how the quality of published geographic data and ensure it can be used for analysis.
