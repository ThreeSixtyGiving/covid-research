These funds were largely administered by The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), although there were contributions from other Government departments. Key parts of the funding included: - The \u00a3200m Coronavirus Community Support Fund - Match funding including the \u00a385m Community Match Challenge and \u00a335m raised during the Big Night In fundraising event - \u00a3360m from Government departments to support charities who have seen an additional need for services Of the \u00a3750m announced, this report includes details of over \u00a3500m. The largest missing piece of data is up to \u00a3200m given to support hospices, for which data has not yet been released, while the remainder includes funds to devolved nations. This funding does overlap with other funds where it was passed through other funders such as the National Emergencies Trust or devolved administrations. Where possible duplicate records have been removed from the dataset. Culture Recovery Fund The Government also made \u00a31.57 billion available as part of the CRF to support cultural organisations that had to close their doors during the pandemic. Not all of this funding has yet been distributed and there are ongoing funds still open, as well as distribution through social investment and loans that are not reflected in the available data. Around \u00a3873m of this funding is included in this report, of which \u00a3750m was distributed by Arts Council England and \u00a3123m by Historic England and the National Lottery Heritage Fund. Data is not available on funding made outside of England from these schemes. Neither DCMS, Arts Council England nor the National Lottery Heritage Fund have made data on the CRF available using the 360Giving Data Standard. To include this data in the report, the data they have published has been transformed into the 360Giving format. In some cases this involved adding additional information that has not been published - such as charity and company numbers for organisations receiving the funding. National Lottery funding As well as being distributors for central Government funding, the National Lottery distributors did make grants using their existing funds. Grants of \u00a3242m made by Sport England are included. This includes both Government-funded grant schemes (like the \u00a3100m COVID-19 National Leisure Recovery Fund for Local Authorities) and schemes funded from Sport England's existing resources. The National Lottery Community Fund (NLCF) was a distributor the the Government's Coronavirus Community Support Fund (\u00a3214m). In this report these funds are categorised under \"DCMS Coronavirus Community Support Fund\". \u00a3128m of grants from NLCF's own funds are also included in this report. These include some Covid-specific funding streams, as well as grants from existing schemes like \u2018Awards for All' that mention Covid. Other National Lottery distributors, including those in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, and Arts Council England do not yet publish data about their funding in the 360Giving Data Standard. Devolved Governments The devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland made their own Covid relief funds available, as well as organising the distribution of some funds from the UK Government. In Scotland, the funds provided by the Scottish Government included: Wellbeing Fund (\u00a326m) Third Sector Resilience Fund (\u00a322m) Communities Recovery Fund (\u00a317m) Supporting Communities Fund (\u00a316m) Adapt and Thrive Programme These funds total \u00a396m and data on them was published by SCVO. In Wales, WCVA has published data on \u00a327m of Covid recovery and resilience funding provided by the Welsh Government, as well as \u00a31.8m of other funding. No information on Government funding from the Northern Ireland Department for Communities has been included in this report. \u00a316m was made available for charities and was distributed by the National Lottery Community Fund, but not included in published data. National Emergencies Trust The National Emergencies Trust (NET) was set up in 2019 to allow coordinated fundraising around domestic UK emergencies. The pandemic response was its first appeal. NET has distributed around \u00a394m in funding following its appeals, using money donated by companies, other charitable trusts, Government and the public. The funds were distributed to partner organisations and to UK Community Foundations for onward distribution to local charities. Not all Community Foundations publish grants data, so not all NET funding is included in this report. Also, Community Foundations and other distributors often contributed their own funds as well as NET funds, so it is not possible to determine what proportion of NET funding is included in the report. A further complication is that Community Foundations and NET also distributed some funding contributed by DCMS, so there is overlap with Government funding. Where possible, duplicate grants have been removed from the dataset. This means that only a proportion of NET-distributed funding and Community Foundations' own grants are included within the data. London Community Response The London Community Response is a coordinated package of funding provided by funders working in London. The 67 funders included have distributed around \u00a357 million in funding. All of this funding is included in this report, either based on open grants data published by the funders themselves, or from data provided by London Funders, who administered the funds. There were some overlaps with other funds: particularly from the London Community Foundation which included funds distributed from NET and DCMS. Community Foundations Community Foundations are grantmakers based in a defined area that provide a way for philanthropists and local people to raise money for local causes. Community Foundations distributed their own funds as well as funding from partners like NET and DCMS. Because not every Community Foundations publishes data, where duplicate grants were detected the non-Community Foundation version was kept (e.g. DCMS grants were kept and duplicate Community Foundation grants removed). This means the report is likely to underestimate Community Foundation grantmaking. Other funds A large number of other funds were included in this report, where the funder has published data using the 360Giving Data Standard. Grants were included where the grant title or description contained \"Covid\" or similar and was within the report timeframe. This means they may not reflect the full size of the grant programmes. Some of the larger funders include: - Wellcome Trust (\u00a368m) - Comic Relief (\u00a367m - as a partner of NET and DCMS) - Garfield Weston Foundation (\u00a355m) - BBC Children in Need (\u00a325m) - Esm\u00e9e Fairbairn Foundation (\u00a320m) - City Bridge Trust (\u00a317m - included within London Community Response) - Paul Hamlyn Foundation (\u00a315m) - Lloyds Bank Foundation for England and Wales (\u00a313m) - Wolfson Foundation (\u00a311m) While the majority of funds included in this report are distributed within the UK, these funds may also include funding for activities outside the UK. Other funds not included Some funds could not be included as they had not openly published their grants data using the 360Giving Data Standard. We would encourage funders to share their grants data in this way, to help future collaboration and research. Some notable funds not included in this report: Barclays' COVID-19 Community Aid Package (\u00a3100m - distributed worldwide) Arts Council England (\u00a397.8m) Julia and Hans Rausing Trust Charity Survival Fund (\u00a318m) Steve Morgan Foundation Covid-19 Emergency Fund (\u00a35.7m) Martin Lewis' Coronavirus Poverty Emergency Fund (\u00a33.4m) Amounts shown above are based on announcements made by the grantmakers.","title":"Appendix I: Covid relief and recovery funds"},{"location":"about-funds/#appendix-i-covid-relief-and-recovery-funds","text":"","title":"Appendix I: Covid relief and recovery funds"},{"location":"about-funds/#government-funding","text":"Following campaigning by the voluntary sector, the Government made a number of funds available for charities and other organisations.

By openly sharing data about their funding, grantmakers are able to respond better to emergencies such as the pandemic. Furthermore, sharing more and higher quality data about grant funding will improve overall charitable giving. This report aims to be a starting point for the exploration of the data collected on Covid relief and recovery grants.

Values This research has been guided by 360Giving's five organisational values: Purposeful - We're focused on driving meaningful change in philanthropy for charities, and improving outcomes for communities and good causes across the UK. Open - We are open in our approach: we share ideas, challenges and lessons with others, and are open to feedback and committed to improvement. Curious - We're inquisitive and we believe in using evidence. Collaborative - We work with funders, charities, researchers, analysts and developers to achieve our objectives, and strive to support them to deliver theirs. Inclusive - We make data, our tools and support accessible to all. We believe that by sharing the data we have collected, what worked - and crucially, what didn't - that this report aligns to all of our organisational values. Covid relief and recovery grants The 2020 Coronavirus pandemic provided a unique challenge to UK charities and the people and communities they serve. Charities needed to meet the massive demand and need for their services, particularly from their most vulnerable users. Yet simultaneously they had to completely stop many of their in-person services and fundraising activities to keep their staff, volunteers and service users safe. Grantmakers recognised the scale and urgency of this emergency, and responded by designing and deploying new grant programmes, as well as adapting existing grants and programmes. These programmes aimed both to: Help organisations meet the increased and unique demands created by the pandemic Help organisations ensure their own survival given anticipated drops in other funding sources 360Giving supported grantmakers to publish data about the grants they had made. We created the COVID-19 Grants Tracker which aggregated the published grants data in a single tool, and enabled collaboration and intelligence sharing between grantmakers. About 360Giving Our mission is to help UK funders publish open, standardised grants data, and empower people to use it to improve charitable giving. When funders publish information on who, where and what they fund in the 360Giving Data Standard it means they are sharing it in a way that others can access and use for free. Because the data is standardised, it can be looked at and analysed all together, helping us to see and understand grantmaking across the UK. Having this information means funding can be more informed and effective. We support people to publish their data in the 360Giving Data Standard. We also help people to access and use the data, and have created tools to make it easy to explore, download and visualise the data.

Funders were able to quickly mobilise resources and coordinate their efforts to support organisations and ensure that the most vulnerable people across the country could be supported through a difficult time. The report shows that that the majority of Covid relief and recovery grants were classed as small grants and were more likely to go to medium-sized registered charities. There was significant overlap between funders: 38% of registered charities received a grant from more than one funder, with 17% receiving funding from three or more funders. But funders also supported parts of the sector they had not reached before, as 26% of recipients had not previously received funding. There are some indications that efforts to address gaps in funding for communities disproportionately affected by the pandemic did make a difference, with a set of these organisations who are registered being more likely to have received funding. The data paints a picture of the landscape of grants for Covid relief and recovery, but the picture is not complete. This report shows what is possible with the data when it is published, but not all grantmakers have published grants about their funding and there are opportunities to improve the quality of data that is published. 360Giving can help grantmakers to: Publish timely data about the grants they have made as open data, using a standard format (the 360Giving Data Standard).

To help you to understand how we have used the data, we have explained what we have collected and our methodology later on in this report. Data released by 174 grantmakers on their relief and recovery funding during the Coronavirus pandemic covers 66,000 grants worth almost \u00a32.4 billion. The majority of grants were small. 67% of grants in the dataset were for \u00a310,000 or less with a further 29% for between \u00a310,000 and \u00a3100,000. Most grants to registered charities went to those charities with an income between \u00a3100,000 and \u00a31 million. Grants were distributed quickly with 42% of grants awarded in, or before, June 2020. Around half of all registered charities that received a grant (48%) received more than one grant in the dataset, including 26% that received three or more grants. This is a recognition of the small size of many of the grants, and that needs changed and developed as the pandemic unfolded. 15% of charities in England and Wales that are registered to work with people of a particular ethnic or racial origin received a grant - a larger proportion than for other groups of service users. This reflects efforts by funders to target and reach communities disproportionately affected by the pandemic. 26% of grant recipients had not previously received funding from the grantmakers featured in the report, suggesting increased outreach by funders to reach new organisations and more flexible funding programmes.

The data covers grants made between the start of the Coronavirus pandemic in March 2020 and October 2021, although not all publishers have data covering the whole period. As well as grant information published in the 360Giving Data Standard, this report supplements the main open dataset with data from key Covid funds that have not yet published in the Standard. These datasets include: Culture Recovery Fund (DCMS funds distributed by Arts Council England) Culture Recovery Fund for Heritage (DCMS funds distributed by National Lottery Heritage Fund) London Community Response (data provided by London Funders) What data is missing? The pandemic has provided an impetus for funders to publish data about their grant funding, in order to better coordinate their activities with the wider sector. However, not all funders who made grants during the pandemic have published data openly about their funding. Where possible, these gaps were filled by accessing other data sources, either published by the funders themselves (but not in the 360Giving Data Standard) or by talking directly to the funders. Some large grant schemes have not published data about their funds, and so cannot be included in the analysis here. This report should therefore be seen as an analysis of a large proportion of the grantmaking that happened during the pandemic, but not the totality. In some cases there also may be duplicate records found in the data. This can happen where a funder took part in multiple collaborative efforts - this can lead to the information being published in more than one place. While all efforts were made to remove any duplicate grants, some may remain in the data. Methodology Data was sourced from the 360Giving Datastore in November 2021, and was supplemented with additional data from other sources. Where possible, an effort was made to add charity and company numbers to the data where they were not already included, in order to de-duplicate between different grant schemes. To create a comparison dataset, data was downloaded from the 360Giving Datastore covering the period from January 2015 to the latest data in October 2021, including all grants that were published during that period. The additional data was gathered from the open data published by Charity Commission for England and Wales, the Scottish Charity Regulator, the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland and Companies House to provide contextual data on charities and registered companies. Where possible, organisation identifiers were standardised to make the consistent, for example by replacing company numbers with charity numbers where an organisation has both. To prevent double-counting, grants were excluded where they were known to have been passed on to another grantmaker (that also publishes 360Giving data) for distribution. This was done by either looking for the charity numbers of known funders in the grant recipient field, or through manual identification of these grants. These grants are not included in the main analysis, although they are examined in the \"regranting\" section. The estimates provided in this report are likely to be partial, in a number of different ways. The data published is not comprehensive, and does not always contain the fields needed for analysis. Note that while some data is drawn from the 360Giving Covid-19 Grants Tracker, the figures presented here will differ from the figures on the tracker. 360Giving works with data publishers to help them increase the quality and completeness of their grants data.

It is important to note that these categories do interact with the pattern seen in the size of organisations - a large number of small charities selected on the register \u201cchildren and young people\u201d as one of their user groups, for example. So the trends for user groups will to a certain extent reflect those underlying patterns.","title":"People supported by grant recipients"},{"location":"grant-recipients/proportion-of-charities/","text":"Proportion of charities receiving a grant One in ten UK charities received a grant Based on 160,000 active registered charities throughout the UK, one in ten charities received a grant from one of the Covid relief funds analysed here.
